# Youtube API

##Most of this code is auto-generated.

But I mostly wanted to explore the possibilities of playing around with the API, doing some csharp coding gather metadata and see what all there is to display and play with regarding the API.

##Some fun things I want to try are:

* Uploads
* Listing out some details and metadata on videos
* Roulette Searches to see what comes up from different countries and regions, definition types
* Storing search result Data
* Whatever fun and games occur to me.
